CS-354 Sec. 1
IA2 - October 22, 2018

This is the second part of the Interpreter Assignment for CS-354.

Unfortunately the first time around, I was unable to spend much time on the
first part of the interpreter, and subsequently was able to get the program
to recognize the unary minus (at the cost of subtraction) and multiple types
of comments in Java (i.e. //, /*, and /**, */). However, for this one I 
decided to restart and spend more time trying to get the grammar, lexemes, 
and tokens to work correctly. I believe I have succeeded in this, unfortunately
I still need to debug the program better, as it is throwing out an error when
parsing (yet it still carries out the operations required faithfully, for 
the most part).

In order to get the project to run you'll have to do the following:

1. $ javac *.java // This compiles all java classes
2. $ java Interpreter "<input 1>" ("<input 2> ...") // Run the program (optional multiple arguments)


There is also a test suite located in: ./src/test/ that will attempt to run some tests,
unfortunately at the moment because of the parsing error being thrown they fail.
