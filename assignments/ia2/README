For this part of the Interpreter Assignment, I had to take a step back
and look at this project from a different angle. Especially, with trying
to integrate the environment class into the project so that it can handle
knowing that multiple arguments can link up together (i.e. each argument 
is no longer an individual program, and previously stated variables can
be used by newer arguments).

All in all, I'm a bit more satisfied with how the interpreter functions
this time around. However, if you were to run the included test suite,
it still "fails" which I'm not enthusiastic about. Now, it doesn't fail 
because it doesn't do the work that is asked of it (you can manually test 
that it gives the required output) but rather in my test files, each line
isn't treated as an argument (and I haven't had time to work this out) so
when the test suite goes to compare /exp and /out to make sure it's right,
it'll say that they aren't equal and print out a failure. (Update: it's 
because the program stops after reaching the ';' and ignores the rest of
the lines in the /prg file). 

Anyways, to run the program (manually or through the test suite) all 
Java files must be compiled using the following:

```````````````````
$ javac /src/*.java

```````````````````

If you're in the IA2 folder for this project, this should compile all the
necessary Java classes. Then you can run the project using either method:

1. $ java Interpreter "<argument 1>" ("<argument 2>" ...)    // Takes in any type of argument using "" to surround it and ';' to end it
2. $ ./run    // This command needs to come from within /src/test/ to run the test suite (which currently shows the tests failing, though
                 running manual tests shows the program works)

This should cover everythin so far in my IA2, wish I could have worked out
the testing suite bugs, but I just did not have the time to work on them.
