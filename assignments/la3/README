This program proved more difficult that I thought it'd be, the conventions
of Prolog did not really sit all that well with me, or at least I could
better say that in the time that I allotted myself to complete I was not
able to fully grasp Prolog and fully implement the predicates as outlined.

To compile and run the program you can either run the bash script 'MAKE'

``````````````````
$ ./MAKE

``````````````````
Or manually compile meet.pl through the GNU Prolog Compiler

```````````````````
$ gplc meet.pl

```````````````````

This should output an executable file called 'meet'
to run it just execute it trough the command line

````````````````````
$ ./meet

```````````````````

Unfotunately, as stated before running this at the moment only spits out
'ann' as I wasn't able to get the program to spit out 'bob' and 'carla'
as they too were available at those times. I hope to be able to get this
corrected in the future on my own time.
