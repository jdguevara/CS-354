The purpose of this assignment was to translate/port a lightswitch program over from its original Java classes to C#. I tried looking at the slides, examples, and online for help. None of which was much help at all, since there were varying examples and doctrines for how people port one language to the other (or how they dislike one of the PLs for not doing what the other can). I tried my best, but I just did not have enough time to finish and focus on other classes. I apologize for not being able to turn in a fully implemented program.
